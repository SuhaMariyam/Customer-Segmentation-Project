# Customer Segmentation: Gaining Actionable Insights

## Project Overview
Understanding customer behavior is crucial for business growth. In this project, we applied clustering techniques to segment customers effectively, revealing distinct groups and valuable insights.

## Our Approach
âœ… **Data Preprocessing & EDA** â€“ Cleaning and exploring patterns.

âœ… **K-Means & Hierarchical Clustering** â€“ Using the **Elbow Method** & **Dendrogram** to determine the optimal number of clusters (**k=2**).

âœ… **Final K-Means Model (k=2)** â€“ Grouping customers based on spending patterns, age, and discounts.

## Key Insights from Clustering
ðŸ“Œ **Cluster 0** â€“ Younger customers (~29 years old), higher spending ($783.25), slightly higher quantity per purchase.

ðŸ“Œ **Cluster 1** â€“ Older customers (~53 years old), slightly lower spending ($765.08), but a similar discount rate.

This segmentation can help businesses tailor their **pricing strategies, promotions, and product recommendations** to different customer groups.
